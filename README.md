## Quark: Real-time, High-resolution, and General Neural View Synthesis

This is an on-going unofficial pytorch implementation of the following paper:

Flynn, John, et al. "[Quark: Real-time, High-resolution, and General Neural View Synthesis.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16680v1)" ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG) 43.6 (2024): 1-20.

## Note

Although I am supposed to implement alone, please let me know if you want to involve in! We may significantly speed the implementation up.

For now this is just for fun and I plan to spend some of my free time, so please also let me know if you want the implementations to be done soon.
